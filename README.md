JULEA is a flexible storage framework that allows offering arbitrary I/O interfaces to applications.
To be able to rapidly prototype new approaches, it offers object, key-value and database backends.
Support for popular storage technologies such as POSIX, LevelDB and MongoDB is already included.

Additionally, JULEA allows dynamically adapting the I/O operations' semantics and can thus be adjusted to different use-cases.
It runs completely in user space, which eases development and debugging.
Its goal is to provide a solid foundation for storage research and teaching.

For more information, please refer to the [documentation](doc/README.md).

## Quick Start

To use JULEA, first clone the Git repository and enter the directory.

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/wr-hamburg/julea.git
$ cd julea
```

JULEA has two mandatory dependencies (GLib and libbson) and several optional ones that enable additional functionality.
The dependencies can either be installed using [your operating system's package manager](doc/dependencies.md#manual-installation) or with JULEA's `install-dependencies` script that installs them into the `dependencies` subdirectory using [Spack](https://spack.io/).
By default, the script will install a useful subset of dependencies;
if you want to install all of them, call it with the `full` argument.

```console
$ ./scripts/install-dependencies.sh
```

To allow the dependencies to be found, the JULEA environment has to be loaded.
This also ensures that JULEA's binaries and libraries are found later.

```console
$ . scripts/environment.sh
```

JULEA now has to be configured using [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/) and compiled using [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/);
the different configuration and build options can be shown with `meson setup --help`.

```console
$ meson setup --prefix="${HOME}/julea-install" -Db_sanitize=address,undefined bld
$ ninja -C bld
```

Finally, a JULEA configuration has to be created.

```console
$ julea-config --user \
  --object-servers="$(hostname)" --kv-servers="$(hostname)" --db-servers="$(hostname)" \
  --object-backend=posix --object-component=server --object-path=/tmp/julea/posix \
  --kv-backend=lmdb --kv-component=server --kv-path=/tmp/julea/lmdb \
  --db-backend=sqlite --db-component=server --db-path=/tmp/julea/sqlite
```

You can check whether JULEA works by executing the integrated test suite.

```console
$ ./scripts/test.sh
```

To get an idea about how to use JULEA from your own application, check out the `example` directory.

```console
$ cd example
$ make run
```

The version is JULEA built using this guide is mainly meant for development and debugging.
If you want to deploy a release version of JULEA, please refer to the documentation about [installation and usage](doc/installation-usage.md).
